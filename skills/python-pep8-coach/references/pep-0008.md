title: "PEP 8 — Judgment-Call Rules (condensed)"
note: >
  Condensed extract of PEP 8 focusing on rules that require human
  judgment and are NOT fully enforced by flake8 or black.

# When to Break the Rules

- Consistency within a project > consistency with PEP 8.
- Do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with PEP 8.
- If applying a rule makes the code less readable, skip it.

# Naming Conventions (human judgment required)

## General Principles

- Names should reflect usage, not implementation.
- Avoid single-letter names except for counters (`i`, `j`, `k`) and
  common conventions (`x`, `y` for coordinates, `e` for exceptions,
  `f` for files).
- Avoid `l` (lowercase L), `O` (uppercase oh), `I` (uppercase i) as
  single-character names — confusable with digits.

## Summary Table

| Type | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Module | `short_lowercase` | `utils`, `my_module` |
| Package | `short_lowercase` (no underscores preferred) | `mypackage` |
| Class | `CapWords` | `MyClass`, `HTTPParser` |
| Exception | `CapWords` + `Error` suffix | `ValueError` |
| Function / Method | `snake_case` | `get_value()` |
| Variable | `snake_case` | `total_count` |
| Constant | `UPPER_SNAKE` | `MAX_RETRIES` |
| Non-public attribute | `_single_leading_underscore` | `_internal` |
| Name-mangled attribute | `__double_leading_underscore` | `__private` |
| "Magic" / dunder | `__double_both__` | `__init__` |
| Type variable | `CapWords` (short) | `T`, `AnyStr` |

## Method Arguments

- Always use `self` for instance method first arg.
- Always use `cls` for classmethod first arg.
- If argument name clashes with reserved word, append underscore
  (`class_`, `type_`). Do NOT use abbreviations or misspellings.

# Import Organization (when isort is unavailable)

Order groups separated by a blank line:
1. Standard library
2. Related third-party
3. Local application/library-specific

Prefer absolute imports. Relative imports are acceptable for complex
package layouts.

Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`) except in
`__init__.py` re-exports.

# Comments and Docstrings (human judgment)

- Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT.
- Update comments when code changes. Misleading comments are worse
  than no comments.
- Block comments: each line starts with `# ` (hash + space).
- Inline comments: sparingly; separated by at least two spaces.
- Docstrings: write for all public modules, functions, classes, and
  methods. Use `"""triple double quotes"""`. PEP 257 for conventions.

# Programming Recommendations (not tool-enforced)

- Use `is` / `is not` for singleton comparison (`None`), not `==`.
- Use `is not` instead of `not ... is`.
- Use `def` for named functions, not assigning lambdas to variables.
- Derive exceptions from `Exception`, not `BaseException`.
- Catch specific exceptions; avoid bare `except:`.
- Use `raise X from Y` to preserve chaining context.
- Use `return` consistently: if any branch returns a value, all
  branches should (`return None` explicitly, not falling through).
- Use `"".startswith()` / `"".endswith()` instead of string slicing.
- Use `isinstance()` instead of `type()` for type checks.
- Use truthiness for empty sequences (`if not seq:`) rather than
  `if len(seq) == 0:`.
- Do not compare booleans with `==` / `is`.
